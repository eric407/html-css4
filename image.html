  <p class="text">A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular
     point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of 
     any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
